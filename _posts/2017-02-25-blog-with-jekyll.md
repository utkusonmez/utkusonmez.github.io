First of all, we should define what jekyll is and what it does. It is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as "a simple, blog aware, static site generator".

##### Steps to test and build a static site generated by Jekyll
1. Install it! [Jekyll installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)
2. gem install jekyll bundler <br />
	You will need that bundler to install dependencies.
3. make a new folder and run 'jekyll new myblog' inside that folder <br />
	Jekyll will generate default static files, which you can edit.
4. bundle install 
5. run 'jekyll serve' <br />
	Your static site is now served at [http://127.0.0.1:4000](http://127.0.0.1:4000). Every change will be published instantly.
6. run 'jekyll build' <br />
	Jekyll will build static files under '_site' folder. When you deploy your static file, users will reach files under _site folder.
